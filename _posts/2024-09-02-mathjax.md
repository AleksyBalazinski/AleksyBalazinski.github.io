If you're (like me) using the Chirpy theme for your Jekyll site, here's how to quickly set up MathJax so that you can display beautiful math equations such as 
 {% raw %}
  $$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0.$$
 {% endraw %}

If you have a look at a site which is generated for you from one of the markdown files for your posts (in the `_site/posts`) folder, you'll see an `index.html` file.
The layout for this file is defined in `_layouts/default.html` file.
The `_layouts` folder, among others can be found in the theme folder; to find its location, run `bundle show jekyll-theme-chirpy`.

Copy the `_layouts` folder to your site's root directory, and include MathJax to your page by appending the line
```html
<script id="MathJax-script" async src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script>
```
to `_layouts/default.html`.

Now, you can write your math!

For example,
```md
{% raw %}{%{% endraw %} raw %}
    $$e^{\pi i} + 1 = 0.$$
{% raw %}{%{% endraw %} endraw %}
```
